      <div class="tagline">Make a mix for your next party</div>
      <p>DJ Wizard is a hack using the echonest js api and the rdio js api (currently in beta). A user adds one song at a time by searching via Rdio. After entering a set of up to 5 songs, the user chooses to add related songs, which creates a static playlist with the echonest api using the selected songs as the seed.</p>
